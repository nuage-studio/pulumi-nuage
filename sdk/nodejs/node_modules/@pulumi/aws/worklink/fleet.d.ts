/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.worklink.Fleet("example", {});
 * ```
 *
 * Network Configuration Usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.worklink.Fleet("example", {network: {
 *     vpcId: aws_vpc.test.id,
 *     subnetIds: [aws_subnet.test.map(__item => __item.id)],
 *     securityGroupIds: [aws_security_group.test.id],
 * }});
 * ```
 *
 * Identity Provider Configuration Usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * import * as fs from "fs";
 *
 * const test = new aws.worklink.Fleet("test", {identityProvider: {
 *     type: "SAML",
 *     samlMetadata: fs.readFileSync("saml-metadata.xml"),
 * }});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * WorkLink can be imported using the ARN, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:worklink/fleet:Fleet test arn:aws:worklink::123456789012:fleet/example
 * ```
