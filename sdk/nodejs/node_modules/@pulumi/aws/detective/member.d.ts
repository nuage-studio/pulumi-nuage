import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Provides a resource to manage an [Amazon Detective Member](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMembers.html).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleGraph = new aws.detective.Graph("exampleGraph", {});
 * const exampleMember = new aws.detective.Member("exampleMember", {
 *     accountId: "AWS ACCOUNT ID",
 *     emailAddress: "EMAIL",
 *     graphArn: exampleGraph.id,
 *     message: "Message of the invitation",
 *     disableEmailNotification: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * `aws_detective_member` can be imported using the ARN of the graph followed by the account ID of the member account, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:detective/member:Member example arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:123456789101:graph:231684d34gh74g4bae1dbc7bd807d02d/123456789012
 * ```
