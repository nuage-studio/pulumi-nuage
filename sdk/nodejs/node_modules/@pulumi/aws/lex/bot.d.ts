 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const orderFlowersBot = new aws.lex.Bot("order_flowers_bot", {
 *     abortStatement: {
 *         messages: [{
 *             content: "Sorry, I am not able to assist at this time",
 *             contentType: "PlainText",
 *         }],
 *     },
 *     childDirected: false,
 *     clarificationPrompt: {
 *         maxAttempts: 2,
 *         messages: [{
 *             content: "I didn't understand you, what would you like to do?",
 *             contentType: "PlainText",
 *         }],
 *     },
 *     createVersion: false,
 *     description: "Bot to order flowers on the behalf of a user",
 *     idleSessionTtlInSeconds: 600,
 *     intents: [{
 *         intentName: "OrderFlowers",

 *     locale: "en-US",
 *     name: "OrderFlowers",
 *     processBehavior: "BUILD",
 *     voiceId: "Salli",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Bots can be imported using their name.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:lex/bot:Bot order_flowers_bot OrderFlowers
 * ```
