/**
 * Provides a Global Accelerator endpoint group.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.globalaccelerator.EndpointGroup("example", {
 *     listenerArn: aws_globalaccelerator_listener.example.id,
 *     endpointConfigurations: [{
 *         endpointId: aws_lb.example.arn,
 *         weight: 100,
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Global Accelerator endpoint groups can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:globalaccelerator/endpointGroup:EndpointGroup example arn:aws:globalaccelerator::111111111111:accelerator/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/listener/xxxxxxx/endpoint-group/xxxxxxxx
 * ```
