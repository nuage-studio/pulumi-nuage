/**
 * Provides an RDS DB proxy resource. For additional information, see the [RDS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.html).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.rds.Proxy("example", {
 *     debugLogging: false,
 *     engineFamily: "MYSQL",
 *     idleClientTimeout: 1800,
 *     requireTls: true,
 *     roleArn: aws_iam_role.example.arn,
 *     vpcSecurityGroupIds: [aws_security_group.example.id],
 *     vpcSubnetIds: [aws_subnet.example.id],
 *     auths: [{
 *         authScheme: "SECRETS",
 *         description: "example",
 *         iamAuth: "DISABLED",
 *         secretArn: aws_secretsmanager_secret.example.arn,
 *     }],
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "example",
 *         Key: "value",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * DB proxies can be imported using the `name`, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:rds/proxy:Proxy example example
 * ```
