/**
 * Manages an App Runner VPC Connector.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const connector = new aws.apprunner.VpcConnector("connector", {
 *     securityGroups: [
 *         "sg1",
 *         "sg2",
 *     ],
 *     subnets: [
 *         "subnet1",
 *         "subnet2",
 *     ],
 *     vpcConnectorName: "name",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * App Runner vpc connector can be imported by using the `arn`, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:apprunner/vpcConnector:VpcConnector example arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:1234567890:vpcconnector/example/1/0a03292a89764e5882c41d8f991c82fe
 * ```
