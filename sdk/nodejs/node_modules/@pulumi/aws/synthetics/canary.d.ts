/**
 * Provides a Synthetics Canary resource.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** When you create a canary, AWS creates supporting implicit resources. See the Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics documentation on [DeleteCanary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteCanary.html) for a full list. Neither AWS nor this provider deletes these implicit resources automatically when the canary is deleted. Before deleting a canary, ensure you have all the information about the canary that you need to delete the implicit resources using the AWS Console, or AWS CLI.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const some = new aws.synthetics.Canary("some", {
 *     artifactS3Location: "s3://some-bucket/",
 *     executionRoleArn: "some-role",
 *     handler: "exports.handler",
 *     runtimeVersion: "syn-1.0",
 *     schedule: {
 *         expression: "rate(0 minute)",
 *     },
 *     zipFile: "test-fixtures/lambdatest.zip",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Synthetics Canaries can be imported using the `name`, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:synthetics/canary:Canary some some-canary
 * ```
