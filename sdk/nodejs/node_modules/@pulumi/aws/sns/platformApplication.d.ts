import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Provides an SNS platform application resource
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Apple Push Notification Service (APNS)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const apnsApplication = new aws.sns.PlatformApplication("apns_application", {
 *     platform: "APNS",
 *     platformCredential: "<APNS PRIVATE KEY>",
 *     platformPrincipal: "<APNS CERTIFICATE>",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const gcmApplication = new aws.sns.PlatformApplication("gcm_application", {
 *     platform: "GCM",
 *     platformCredential: "<GCM API KEY>",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * SNS platform applications can be imported using the ARN, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:sns/platformApplication:PlatformApplication gcm_application arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:0123456789012:app/GCM/gcm_application
 * ```
