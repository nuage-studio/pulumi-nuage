import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Registers a Lake Formation resource (e.g., S3 bucket) as managed by the Data Catalog. In other words, the S3 path is added to the data lake.
 *
 * Choose a role that has read/write access to the chosen Amazon S3 path or use the service-linked role. When you register the S3 path, the service-linked role and a new inline policy are created on your behalf. Lake Formation adds the first path to the inline policy and attaches it to the service-linked role. When you register subsequent paths, Lake Formation adds the path to the existing policy.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleBucket = aws.s3.getBucket({
 *     bucket: "an-example-bucket",
 * });
 * const exampleResource = new aws.lakeformation.Resource("exampleResource", {arn: exampleBucket.then(exampleBucket => exampleBucket.arn)});
 * ```
