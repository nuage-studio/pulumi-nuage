/**
 * Provides a Redshift Cluster Resource.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** A Redshift cluster's default IAM role can be managed both by this resource's `defaultIamRoleArn` argument and the `aws.redshift.ClusterIamRoles` resource's `defaultIamRoleArn` argument. Do not configure different values for both arguments. Doing so will cause a conflict of default IAM roles.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.redshift.Cluster("example", {
 *     clusterIdentifier: "tf-redshift-cluster",
 *     clusterType: "single-node",
 *     databaseName: "mydb",
 *     masterPassword: "Mustbe8characters",
 *     masterUsername: "exampleuser",
 *     nodeType: "dc1.large",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Redshift Clusters can be imported using the `cluster_identifier`, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:redshift/cluster:Cluster myprodcluster tf-redshift-cluster-12345
 * ```
