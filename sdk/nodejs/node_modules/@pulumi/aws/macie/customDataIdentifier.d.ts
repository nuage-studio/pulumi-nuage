/**
 * Provides a resource to manage an [AWS Macie Custom Data Identifier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/APIReference/custom-data-identifiers-id.html).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleAccount = new aws.macie2.Account("exampleAccount", {});
 * const exampleCustomDataIdentifier = new aws.macie.CustomDataIdentifier("exampleCustomDataIdentifier", {
 *     regex: "[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}",
 *     description: "DESCRIPTION",
 *     maximumMatchDistance: 10,
 *     keywords: ["keyword"],
 *     ignoreWords: ["ignore"],
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [aws_macie2_account.test],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * `aws_macie2_custom_data_identifier` can be imported using the id, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:macie/customDataIdentifier:CustomDataIdentifier example abcd1
 * ```
