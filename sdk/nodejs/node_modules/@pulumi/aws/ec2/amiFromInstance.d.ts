/**
 * The "AMI from instance" resource allows the creation of an Amazon Machine
 * Image (AMI) modelled after an existing EBS-backed EC2 instance.
 *
 * The created AMI will refer to implicitly-created snapshots of the instance's
 * EBS volumes and mimick its assigned block device configuration at the time
 * the resource is created.
 *
 * This resource is best applied to an instance that is stopped when this instance
 * is created, so that the contents of the created image are predictable. When
 * applied to an instance that is running, *the instance will be stopped before taking
 * the snapshots and then started back up again*, resulting in a period of
 * downtime.
 *
 * Note that the source instance is inspected only at the initial creation of this
 * resource. Ongoing updates to the referenced instance will not be propagated into
 * the generated AMI. Users may taint or otherwise recreate the resource in order
 * to produce a fresh snapshot.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.ec2.AmiFromInstance("example", {
 *     sourceInstanceId: "i-xxxxxxxx",
 * });
 * ```
