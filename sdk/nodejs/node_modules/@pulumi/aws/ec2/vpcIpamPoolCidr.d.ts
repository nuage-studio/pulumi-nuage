/**
 * Provisions a CIDR from an IPAM address pool.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Provisioning Public IPv4 or Public IPv6 require [steps outside the scope of this resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html#prepare-for-byoip). The resource accepts `message` and `signature` as part of the `cidrAuthorizationContext` attribute but those must be generated ahead of time. Public IPv6 CIDRs that are provisioned into a Pool with `publiclyAdvertisable = true` and all public IPv4 CIDRs also require creating a Route Origin Authorization (ROA) object in your Regional Internet Registry (RIR).
 *
 * > **NOTE:** In order to deprovision CIDRs all Allocations must be released. Allocations created by a VPC take up to 30 minutes to be released. However, for IPAM to properly manage the removal of allocation records created by VPCs and other resources, you must [grant it permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/choose-single-user-or-orgs-ipam.html) in
 * either a single account or organizationally. If you are unable to deprovision a cidr after waiting over 30 minutes, you may be missing the Service Linked Role.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * IPAMs can be imported using the `<cidr>_<ipam-pool-id>`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:ec2/vpcIpamPoolCidr:VpcIpamPoolCidr example 172.2.0.0/24_ipam-pool-0e634f5a1517cccdc
 * ```
