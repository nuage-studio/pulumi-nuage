/**
 * Provides a CodeStar Host.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** The `aws.codestarconnections.Host` resource is created in the state `PENDING`. Authentication with the host provider must be completed in the AWS Console. For more information visit [Set up a pending host](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/connections-host-setup.html).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.codestarconnections.Host("example", {
 *     providerEndpoint: "https://example.com",
 *     providerType: "GitHubEnterpriseServer",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * CodeStar Host can be imported using the ARN, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:codestarconnections/host:Host example-host arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-west-1:0123456789:host/79d4d357-a2ee-41e4-b350-2fe39ae59448
 * ```
