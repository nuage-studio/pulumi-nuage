 * Retrieve information about the AWS Direct Connect locations in the current AWS Region.
 * These are the locations that can be specified when configuring [`aws.directconnect.Connection`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_connection.html) or [`aws.directconnect.LinkAggregationGroup`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_lag.html) resources.
 *
 * > **Note:** This data source is different from the [`aws.directconnect.getLocation`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/d/dx_location.html) data source which retrieves information about a specific AWS Direct Connect location in the current AWS Region.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const available = pulumi.output(aws.directconnect.getLocations());
 * ```
