/**
 * Manages a Route53 Hosted Zone. For managing Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), see the `aws.route53.KeySigningKey` and `aws.route53.HostedZoneDnsSec` resources.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Public Zone
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const primary = new aws.route53.Zone("primary", {});
 * ```
 * ### Public Subdomain Zone
 *
 * For use in subdomains, note that you need to create a
 * `aws.route53.Record` of type `NS` as well as the subdomain
 * zone.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const main = new aws.route53.Zone("main", {});
 * const dev = new aws.route53.Zone("dev", {tags: {
 *     Environment: "dev",
 * }});
 * const dev_ns = new aws.route53.Record("dev-ns", {
 *     zoneId: main.zoneId,
 *     name: "dev.example.com",
 *     type: "NS",
 *     ttl: 30,
 *     records: dev.nameServers,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Private Zone
 *
 * > **NOTE:** This provider provides both exclusive VPC associations defined in-line in this resource via `vpc` configuration blocks and a separate ` Zone VPC Association resource. At this time, you cannot use in-line VPC associations in conjunction with any  `aws.route53.ZoneAssociation`  resources with the same zone ID otherwise it will cause a perpetual difference in plan output. You can optionally use [ `ignoreChanges` ](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/programming-model/#ignorechanges) to manage additional associations via the  `aws.route53.ZoneAssociation` resource.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Private zones require at least one VPC association at all times.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const _private = new aws.route53.Zone("private", {vpcs: [{
 *     vpcId: aws_vpc.example.id,
 * }]});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Route53 Zones can be imported using the `zone id`, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:route53/zone:Zone myzone Z1D633PJN98FT9
 * ```
