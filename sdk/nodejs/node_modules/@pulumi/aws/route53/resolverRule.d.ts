/**
 * Provides a Route53 Resolver rule.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### System rule
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const sys = new aws.route53.ResolverRule("sys", {
 *     domainName: "subdomain.example.com",
 *     ruleType: "SYSTEM",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Forward rule
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const fwd = new aws.route53.ResolverRule("fwd", {
 *     domainName: "example.com",
 *     ruleType: "FORWARD",
 *     resolverEndpointId: aws_route53_resolver_endpoint.foo.id,
 *     targetIps: [{
 *         ip: "123.45.67.89",
 *     }],
 *     tags: {
 *         Environment: "Prod",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Route53 Resolver rules can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:route53/resolverRule:ResolverRule sys rslvr-rr-0123456789abcdef0
 * ```
