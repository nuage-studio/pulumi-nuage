/**
 * Provides a Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rule group association resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleResolverFirewallRuleGroup = new aws.route53.ResolverFirewallRuleGroup("exampleResolverFirewallRuleGroup", {});
 * const exampleResolverFirewallRuleGroupAssociation = new aws.route53.ResolverFirewallRuleGroupAssociation("exampleResolverFirewallRuleGroupAssociation", {
 *     firewallRuleGroupId: exampleResolverFirewallRuleGroup.id,
 *     priority: 100,
 *     vpcId: aws_vpc.example.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rule group associations can be imported using the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rule group association ID, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:route53/resolverFirewallRuleGroupAssociation:ResolverFirewallRuleGroupAssociation example rslvr-frgassoc-0123456789abcdef
 * ```
